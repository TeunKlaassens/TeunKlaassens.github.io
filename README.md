Welcome to my website where I document my progress as a computer science student!

About

This website is a place where I showcase my projects, share my experiences, and reflect on what I'm learning in my computer science studies. I'm constantly working on new projects and learning new things, and I wanted to create a space where I could share my progress and connect with others in the field.

Projects

On my website, you'll find a variety of projects that I've worked on, including web applications, mobile apps, and software development projects. Each project page includes a brief overview of the project, the technologies used, and a link to the project's source code.

Blog

In addition to my project pages, I also maintain a blog where I write about my experiences as a computer science student. I share my thoughts on the latest developments in the field, reflect on my progress, and offer advice to other students who are just starting out.
